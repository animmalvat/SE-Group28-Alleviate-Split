# SE-Group28-Alleviate-Split
splitting bill project for software engineering group

We had a hard time finding an appropriate project idea and therefore, we are running little behind. 
This will be our project repository and we will start producing code as soon as possible. </br>
We have already started protoyping: https://github.com/animmalvat/group-28-project-prototype-2  </br>
You can take a look at our prototype.
