# SE-Group28-Alleviate-Split
splitting bill project for software engineering group

We had a hard time finding an appropriate project idea and therefore, we are running little behind. 
This will be our project repository and we will start producing code as soon as possible. 
We have already started protoyping: https://github.com/animmalvat/group-28-project-prototype-2 
You can take a look at our prototype.
